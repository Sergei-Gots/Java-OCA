    synchronized - supported with a separated process flow
                    to avoid multiple use of a single resource.

    volatile - for a variable that should be modified within 
            different flows and this change will be
            seen in all the flows.

    stictfp - since Java 1.2. - limits accuracy
            of calculations with float and double
            according IEEE
